Man, this movie... Cleaner, what the heck. I’m still trying to wrap my head around it. Just walked out, popcorn bits still under my nails and sticky soda somehow on my elbow. The theater was crazy loud, people rustling like they’re digging for fossils, seriously. My back’s been aching from the terrible seats, like someone jammed a rock in there. Anyways.

So, Cleaner, right? starts to remember scenes It’s not just about cleaning, man, it’s like... the chaos of dirt and disorder, almost makes me think of tectonic plates shifting. That one scene where the dude is scrubbing a floor, and it suddenly turns into this cosmic whirlpool of dust and particles, like stars being born or something. Nuts. And then, BOOM out of nowhere, a janitor wielding a mop like it's a sword. People were laughing but also in awe, kinda like how you feel when you're staring at volcanic lava - dangerous but also mesmerizing.

>The soundtrack was like a landslide in the background, crashing your ears in the best way possible. It's like when you can hear the rocks sizzle under the sun during a desert hike - unexpected and thrilling. And huge props to the director for making the simplest thing, like a broom sweeping, feel monumental, like rivers cutting through canyons over eons. Got a bit lost in my own thoughts... or was it the dust from the projector? 

I kept thinking about that question someone texted me earlier, “should I download the movie or just watch the movie later?” Dude, do both. Somehow.

Random but the visuals, at one point, like glacial ice melting but backward. Got me thinking of those tremors beneath the crust that are barely felt but there, always there. Just when I was getting comfortable, the crunch from some leftover popcorn pulled me back into the seat and reality. Reminded me of rock sediment, building for eons, only to crumble under pressure. Reality check in buttery disguise.

By the end, it felt like they'd cleaned not just rooms but memories, dreams, or... I dunno, something deeper. My brain’s still unsorted like a drawer stuffed with old geological survey maps, each scene a different map. Chaotic but beautiful in its own scattered way.

    while (truth) {
        let chaos = Math.random()  universe;
        if (chaos > sanity) {
            break;
        }
    never.organize(life);
    return null;
}
